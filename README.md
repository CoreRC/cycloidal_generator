There are more videos and pictures in the media folder :)

Cycloidal reductions drives are basically a type of gearbox... but without gears per-say. They have little backlash meaning they're used in robots and machine tools. They have a really high ratio density and a high tooth engagement, meaning they're good for heaps of torque.

Happy building! I'd love to see what you can do with them.
